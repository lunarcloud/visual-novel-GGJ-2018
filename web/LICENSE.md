End User License Agreement
==========================

  1. Under this Software License Agreement (the "Agreement"), Samuel James Sarette (the "Vendor") grants to the user (the "Licensee") a non-exclusive and non-transferable license (the "License") to use TODO (the "Software").

  2. "Software" includes the executable computer programs and any related printed, electronic and online documentation and any other files that may accompany the product.

  3. “Source Code” includes the files used to create the executable computer programs as well as reverse-engineered or decompiled files generated from the executable computer programs.

  4. “Proprietary Source Code” includes any portion of the Source Code that is not licensed under an open-source license.

  5. Title, copyright, intellectual property rights and distribution rights of the Software remain exclusively with the Vendor. Intellectual property rights include the look and feel of the Software. This Agreement constitutes a license for use only and is not in any way a transfer of ownership rights to the Software.

  6. The Software may be loaded onto an unlimited number of computers for use by the Licensee only. An unlimited number of copies may be made for backup purposes only.

  7. The rights and obligations of this Agreement are personal rights granted to the Licensee only. The Licensee may not transfer or assign any of the rights or obligations granted under this Agreement to any other person or legal entity. The Licensee may not make available the Software for use by any third parties.

  8. The Licensee may make the Software available for use by third-parties for educational purposes, as part of a public exhibit, i.e. at a museum, or at a short-run event, e.g. in the game room of a convention, but not as part of an ongoing installation, i.e. an arcade.

  9. The Licensee may only make modifications available free-of-charge, as description, patch, installer, or combination thereof. The Licensee may not make available any copy of the Software with the modifications already included. The Licensee may only modify the Software for the following purposes:
    1. To improve technical accessibility of the Software, e.g. to support an exotic or updated computing platform.
    2. To improve upon the human accessibility of the Software, e.g. adding support for an additional language.
    3. To improve or add features in the Software, e.g. add a new weapon or level.

  10. The Licensee installs and uses the Software at their own risk. The Vendor is not liable for any damages or losses incurred during the installation, the state of being installed, nor the use of the Software.

  11. Failure to comply with any of the terms under the License section will be considered a material breach of this Agreement. Should the licensee fail to comply, they must destroy all personal copies of the Software, and the Vendor reserves the right to deny requests for subsequent licenses with the Licensee.

  12. Should the Vendor transfer the rights to another party, to the Software's title, copyright, intellectual property and/or distribution, this Agreement is still valid, but recognizes the new Vendor or Vendors.

  13. Should the Vendor no longer exist or no longer retain the rights to the Software, and the Vendor has not transferred the rights to any other party or parties, the sections of the Software without external ownership, third-party licensed technology, shall be considered to have entered the Public Domain by automatic switch to a Creative Commons 0 version 1.0 Universal Public Domain license, and to no longer be bound by the restrictions of this Agreement.
