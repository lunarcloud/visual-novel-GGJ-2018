# Visual Novel [for the Global Game Jam 2018](https://globalgamejam.org/2018/games/switchboard-copper)
A series of more and more interesting crimes comes through the station as you play a switchboard policeman in [the fictional world of Antiford]( https://citizensofantiford.com ).

## Technology
Integrated the [Ink language](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/) into [ImpactJS]( http://impactjs.com/ ), [Unity]( https://unity3d.com/ ), [Godot]( https://godotengine.org/ ), and compare it with the non-ink vn experience, [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/)

## Web version
You can either run the pre-baked index.html or use the dev.html.
ImpactJS engine is included now that it is open-source.
There are scripts within the tools folder for packaging for desktop.

_This was the version created within the Jam time._

## Godot version
Open with Godot 3.1 or newer.
The engine is completely open-source and the project will export to all platforms: desktop, web, and mobile.
Make sure to add "ink/main.json" to the extra-files-to-export filter in each export preset you add.

## Unity version
Open with Unity 2018.3.0f2 or newer.

### U
The standard 2D version.

### VR
The 3D recreation for the Google Daydream VR platform.

## Ren'Py Version
This version __does not use ink__. It instead uses the re'py platform's conventions for story definition. It is provided for comparison's sake.
Additionally, the "daily menu" has not been implemented in its graphical form. That seems complex, but it may come eventually.
